# Review-Ranker
It's a web based application for provide ranking to the reviews on the basis of review content.

## what's the issue??
--------------------

Online shopping is more convenient and efficient than shopping at a department store.
There are a number of perks of shopping online but there are few drawbacks as well. One of the main ones being the inability to physically hold and assess the quality of the product before purchase.
In such cases, we rely on the reviews of that particular product to see if it matches our needs.

Consider the example case:
   Suppose a person A has reviewed a product a month ago and his review now is having some number of upvotes because many people have read that,
   and there is a person B who just added the review and described the product in much better way than the person A. Now if we sort our reviews on the
   basis of the upvotes than the person A's review would be on the top.
   So, we aimed to design a review-ranker platform which will rank the reviews on the basis of the content of the reviews.
